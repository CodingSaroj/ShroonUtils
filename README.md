# Shroon Utils

A header-only library written in C89 (also known as ANSI C). This is made for use in other Shroon
libraries but you can use it in your project as well.

## Features

For now, this library contains only implementations of dynamic array (also called vector), string,
hash map and hash set. But in future the features might be expanded.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found [here](https://shroonutils.readthedocs.io/).
